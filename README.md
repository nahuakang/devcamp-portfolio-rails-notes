# Nahua's Ruby on Rails Notes for Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5 Course
This is a collection of my notes on Jordan Hudgens' Udemy course: [Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-rails-5-development-course).

Please note that the notes do not include each section of the course. I took the notes more extensively before section 14, when there was a lot of walkthroughs on the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails. Around section 14, the nature of the course becomes more practical and implementation-oriented, where it become less possible to take notes.
